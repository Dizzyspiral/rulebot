# Rulebot

Rulebot is a slackbot that can be "programmed" with pattern-matching rules in order fire an event when these rules are matched.

## Rules

See `greetingrules.py` for an example of a rule. A more detailed explanation will follow in later commits.

## Bot configuration

Bot configuration is contained in `botconfig.py`. This information is used for establishing a connection to the server. In the examples, it is also used for differentiating the bot from other users when creating rules.
